# hello-world
introductory repository to get used to github

Whats up friends! University student here, learning CS for the first time using GitHub. I'm a biochemistry and molecular biology major and I figured coding will be useful for doing research and manipulating data in the future. I'm very excited about my intro CS course cause theres so much new stuff and so many directions it can go. 
As my first project, hello-world is just to get used to github and exxplore some of the things i can do.
So here I am, let's do this!
